<p><em>This post is part of a series on the plastic compiler<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Each post will cover one pass in the compiler. The first post is <a href="/compiler/lexer.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, by this stage we have a representation of what each file contains and it’s time to start working out what it means. To do this, we need to go through the process of type checking.</p>
<p>However, in order to check that terms have well-defined types, we first need to know that the types have well-defined kinds and in order to do that, we need to know that the kinds have well defined sorts.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly, plastic has four layers of things. Fortunately though, the sort layer is simple. There’s only one sort and users don’t currently have the ability to define new kinds, so sort checking is straight forward.</p>
<p>All we have to do is ensure that when we mention a kind, the kind actually exists.</p>
