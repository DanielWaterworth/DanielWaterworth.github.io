Try this (and don't read ahead). You'll need a piece of paper and a
pen. Ready? Do you have a pen in your hand right now? If not, stop
reading and get one.

 1. Write down a list of twenty questions. They can be any questions
    you like but they must be answerable and you must not already know the
    answer to them,
 2. For each question, write down the effects of knowing the answer and
    actions you would take,
 3. For each question again, write down either a short list of other
    questions that would need to be answered first (put these all in
    another list) or write down what you could do to find out the answer,
 4. Take this new list of questions and go back to step 2. Continue after 2
    repeats.

Now, are their steps towards answering those questions that you would
like to take? What's stopping you?
