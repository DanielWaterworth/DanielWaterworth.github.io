<p>Let’s start with an observation:</p>
<p><em>There are two kinds of things you can do. You can do something that’s been done before or you can do something that’s never been done.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doing something that has been done before is low-risk.</strong> After a factory has produced a million pens, you can be quite sure that it can produce the million and first.</p>
<p><strong>Doing something that you’ve never done is higher-risk.</strong> If you’ve never painted a portrait and you need to paint a good one before a deadline, you may not succeed.</p>
<p><strong>But doing something that no-one has done before is the highest-risk.</strong> The first person to climb Everest took a greater risk than the second person.</p>
<p>Here’s another observation: when you hire an employee, the employee is doing two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They are doing work,</li>
<li>They are taking risks,</li>
</ol>
<p>If you instruct your employee to build a wall, the work that they do has been effectively delegated as you no longer need to build a wall.</p>
<p>But the risks that your employee has taken have not been delegated. If your employee, in the course of building the wall, decided to use a different kind of brick, they took a risk. Since you are now the owner of the wall, you took a risk too.</p>
<p>For this reason, whether it is articulated this way or not, employees are trained to be risk averse.</p>
<p>The last observation I have to make is this: The important, valuable work in the world is high-risk. Low-risk work can be automated and done by machines, but risk-taking cannot be automated. If a machine takes a risk under your command, then so do you.</p>
<p>If you want to learn to do valuable things, you must learn to take risks.</p>
