Inspired by Seth Godin, I've decided to start writing everyday[^1].

Writing has a permanence that makes releasing it intimidating. It's hard to put
your name to something; it's emotional labour. But it's something that I want
to become more comfortable with and something that I want to get better at.

How does anyone improve at anything without going through the process of making
necessary mistakes? So, here I am, throwing my poorly written pros out into the
wild blue yonder.
