*This is a follow-on post from yesterday's ["Go's
Solvability"](./2018_01_28.html).*

In yesterday's post, I wrote about Go and its ability to be solved;
that is, that there exists a strategy that will guarantee a win to
one side. I showed you that such a strategy exists without giving you
one. In fact, I couldn't give you one if I wanted to, since I don't know
of any.

I do know, however, how such a strategy could be shown to be effective,
but what I really want to show you today is that what I have to say
about Go strategies has huge implications for the way that we learn to
do everything and even hints at the nature of creativity.

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that I have a strategy that
guarantees a win for black (who goes first). This means that I know where
to put the first stone and that after white has gone, based on their move,
I know where I will put the next stone and so on and so forth.

This strategy could be visualized as a huge tree of possibilities, like this:

![fractal tree](../images/tree.png)

Each of the forks in the tree represents a decision that the other side
could make and each line represents an action that you will take. At every
position in the tree there is a game board state.

Now, for Go, this tree would be truly gargantuan. Many branches will have
hundreds of subtrees. There isn't enough matter in the known universe to
create paper to print out the entirety of a complete Go decision tree.

But, imagine that such a tree existed and I was trying to demonstrate
the efficacy of it. What would I need to show you? Would it be enough to
show you that every possible white move is accounted for and that every
end point is a win for black? I hope that you agree that it is.

Now, look at the image above again; notice that at every forking point,
each tree is made of two sub-trees. In Go, my perfect strategy would be
made up of sub-strategies, which in turn would be made up of smaller
sub-strategies and so on.

One method you could use for verifying my strategy is to work your way
inward, starting with the smallest sub-strategies and moving towards
the larger ones until you reach the root. By doing this, you would be
working backwards through the game play.

This is also a good way of producing the strategy; starting first with
all valid board positions where black wins. Then, looking backwards in
time, finding all board positions where black is sure to win in one
move, then two moves and so on.

Without external instruction, this is also the way that Go players learn
to play Go. First, they learn to play well in the end game and they
gradually work their way backwards until they are good at starting too.

**In fact, it is the way that we learn to do everything.**

First, we find strategies to immediately accomplish our goals. Then,
as we learn, we find strategies that allow us to accomplish our goals
further and further down the line.

Imagine that you need to compose a symphony. Immediately attempting to
put notes on the score is unlikely to yield anything remarkable, but if
you started by learning to make 5 note melodies and gradually built up
to larger and more complex pieces, in time you would be able to create
impressive arrangements.

Learning requires stepping stones like this. These stepping stones allow
us to build up to larger and more intricate strategies. We continually
require new opportunities that are slightly ahead of where we have
progressed to in order to learn the next piece of our internal strategy.

So, next time you are learning to do something, think about the tree
above and what experience you require to make your internal strategy a
little bit more intricate.
