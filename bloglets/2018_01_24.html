<p>Try this (and don’t read ahead). You’ll need a piece of paper and a pen. Ready? Do you have a pen in your hand right now? If not, stop reading and get one.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write down a list of twenty questions. They can be any questions you like but they must be answerable and you must not already know the answer to them,</li>
<li>For each question, write down the effects of knowing the answer and actions you would take,</li>
<li>For each question again, write down either a short list of other questions that would need to be answered first (put these all in another list) or write down what you could do to find out the answer,</li>
<li>Take this new list of questions and go back to step 2. Continue after 2 repeats.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, are their steps towards answering those questions that you would like to take? What’s stopping you?</p>
