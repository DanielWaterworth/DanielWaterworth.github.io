<p>First, some troubling data:</p>

</figure>
<p>This graph is explained by the book “Average is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation”, in which Tyler Cowen argues that the economy is in the process of bifurcating into those who are able to effectively utilize technology and those who aren’t.</p>
<p>In this dystopian future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a small minority [who are] highly educated and capable of working collaboratively with automated systems will become a wealthy aristocracy; the vast majority will earn little or nothing, surviving on low-priced goods created by the first group, living in shantytowns working with highly automated production systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Is this future inevitable? I want to argue that it isn’t. I do agree that the economy is spliting, but I disagree on an important presupposition.</p>
<p>Cowen assumes that this group of technocrati must necessarily be small and this makes sense if you believe that the economy is bounded. With only so much of the pie to go around and with so few able to create so much, few succeed.</p>
<p>But, if the economy is unbounded, and opportunities to create new kinds of value will always be present, then this assumption is wrong. There is no bound on the number of technocrats, but that still leaves one rather large problem.</p>
<p>How does one become a technocrat?</p>
<p>Well, a technocrat, in this context, is someone who is capable of utilizing technology for there own ends. So, becoming a technocrat means learning to wield technology. The obvious way to do this is to learn to program, but it is not the only way.</p>
<p>Before industrial agriculture, farmers were the ones who created the value in the world, but they weren’t the only ones who benefited from their work. In the feudal age, farmers worked for lords who controlled the balance of power.</p>
<p><strong>We are in another feudal age now, where programmers are the new farmers.</strong> So, to be a part of the new economy, you must be employ or be a ‘programmer’ (where a ‘programmer’ is just someone who is able to make a computer do arbitrary things).</p>
