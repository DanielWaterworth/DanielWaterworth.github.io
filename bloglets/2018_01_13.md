% A Product of its Environment

Nothing is made or done in a vacuum. Nothing is written without a
cultural or social bias - nothing is built that doesn't mirror the world that
it came from; "unbiased" is unattainable.

Everything is a product of its environment. 'Successful things' are not
things that are somehow 'objectively better', but merely things that
are better adapted to the environment that they exist in.

Perhaps the reason we have buggy software is that our actions show that
we _are_ willing to put up with bugs. Perhaps we wouldn't have large
tech companies that sell our data if people were more conscious of their
personal data.

*There's a good talk on how stackoverflow tried to manipulate the
environment that questions and answers exist in to make it more helpful
to others here[^1]*.
